# The continuation of the main line of Giuoco Pianissimo opening as White

First, obviously White needs to open with **e4** and Black needs to response with **e5**

1. **e4 e5**
2. **Nf3 Nc6**

After White's **Nf3**, Black can naturally respond with **Nc6** or **Nf6**, which will lead to Petrov's Defense, but White can defend **e4** with **d3**

3. **Bc4 Bc5**

**Bc4** leads to Italian Game. However, Black has one other natural move to make other than **Bc5**, which is **Nf6**. **d3** should be played before castling

4. **O-O Nf6**
5. **d3 O-O**
6. **c3 d3**

Any variations above will lead to the main line of Giuoco Pianissimo.

7. **b4 Bb6**
8. **a4 a5**

Here, White can aggresively take space in the queenside. Black's best chance after **a4** is **a5** according to engine, but White can further take space by playing **b5**

9. **b5 Ne7**

The only good square for Black's knight is **e7**
